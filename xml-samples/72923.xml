  <Overview>Professor Robinson discovers that the planets orbit will bring immense heat on the spaceship. With that knowledge the Robinson's take off in the chariot and head south.  However back at the Jupiter two, Dr Smith who stayed behind because he believed them to be lying, realises that the orbit is strange, bringing immense cold followed by extreme heat. He sends the Robot to tell them, and they then attempt to travel back to the Jupiter 2.  However in their way is a huge in-land sea which previously had been frozen solid.  The immense heat and cold make the vegetation charred.  They survive the heat and return to the Jupiter Two where they are most safe.</Overview>

  <Overview>Lost in Space's only Christmas program.  Will uses an alien transporter to send himself back to earth. However, many people believe the Robinson family to be dead after hearing the ship went off course.  Nobody on Earth believes him, and they lock him up with the intention of sending him to a boys' home.
Will escapes the family home he's in, and wanders around these clueless bunch of townspeople, but finds carbon tetrachoride - needed for the food processors on the Jupiter. Eventually he convinces another boy Davey to let him out, and let him return to the planet he came from. He returns to Priplanis with this bottle.  Of course no one believes his adventures until he produces the bottle, plainly labeled as coming from earth.</Overview>

  <Overview>Shortly after leaving their original crash-site planet, Smith spots a familiar star and, in an amazing show of stellar navigational skill, calculates the course to get back to Earth.
He extracts a promise from Don and John that they'll return to Earth, or else he'll destroy his navigation data.  They agree, but inform the family at dinnertime that they are headed for Alpha Centauri after all, mainly because the Earth is on the other side of the Sun (how do they know that? - do they know the date?

They reach a refueling barge, one of several that Alpha Control put out in 1996, top up the tanks, and resume course for Alpha Centauri, not knowing that they've picked up a tailgater who follows them after Smith reverses course to Earth again.

  <Overview>During a heat wave, Penny comes across a giant, golden man, and his owner.  She is told that the creature is called Raddion, a creation which only needs human emotions to be complete.  When Dr Smith is removed from the camp, he is taken by two midgets who work with Raddion, and in another atempt to be returned to Earth, agrees to get the emotions from the Robinsons.  He does so by taking their pictures, and all that is needed is for the Robinsons to shake hands with him.  Don protests and heads back for camp, as do the Robinsons minus their emotions.  Eventually they are returned to normal and it is learnt that human emotions cannot be bought or stolen.</Overview>

  <Overview>The primitive beings are actually wards of a computer, Protinius, which can confer temporary advanced sentience on the leading man in order to communicate Protinius' will.
The episode also features a temporary camaraderie between Don and Smith, a burying of the hatchet, when Don is rescued by Smith from a pit, and then says &quot;&quot;Doctor Smith&quot;&quot; - using the word Doctor for the first time unknown ages.  However, their camaraderie dissolves and the characters are back to &quot;&quot;normal&quot;&quot;.  Not the first time Smith has become selfless and a man of some integrity, but as usual, Smith returns to normal.</Overview>

  <Overview>Will is conducting an experiment in a cave and captures a man who claims to be the man who controls time for the entire universe.  This &quot;&quot;Time Merchant&quot;&quot; takes Will, Professor Robinson, Smith, and the Robot, to his secret lair.  From there, Smith uses the Time Merchant's time machine to return himself to Earth on the day the Robinson's departed, with the objective of NOT sabotaging the Jupiter II mission and letting the Robinsons go on their way to Alpha Centauri.  The Time Merchant then announces that if Smith does not get on the Jupiter II, the ship will not fly off course and will therefore be destroyed by a collision with an asteroid several months after liftoff.  So Will is sent back to join Smith and try to convince him to get on the Jupiter II as he originally did.</Overview>

  <Overview>The Robot suddenly announces that the Jupiter II is approaching Alpha Centauri.  Everyone is suprised, and the ship lands on a planet, where they are greeted by a group of people who appear to be teenagers from Earth.  It turns out that they are aliens who live like Earth-style hippies, and they are incapable of growing old.  They want to age normally, and to do this they want to get the older members of the Robinson party to leave in the Jupiter II while the younger members can stay behind and be used in an experiment that will make it possible for them to do so.  The aliens trick the older members of the Robinson party into leaving, but Will pulls a fast one on the aliens and the Jupiter II eventually returns to the planet, and Penny, Will, and Dr. Smith, who somehow passed himself off as a young person, are rescued.</Overview>
